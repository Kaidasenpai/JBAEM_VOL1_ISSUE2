### Abstract

Foreign  body  ingestion  constitutes  a  significant  clinical  emergency, particularly  among  the  pediatric  age  group  but  also  affecting  adults, often leading to serious or life-threatening complications. Presentation commonly varies depending on the ingested object's type and location; potential  sequelae  include  mucosal  injury,  perforation,  mediastinitis, and abscess formation. We report two cases of sharp foreign body ingestion with distinct predisposing circumstances: The first case, an 11-year-old boy who ingested a sewing needle following peer provocation. The second case, an 18-year-old female fashion designer who accidentally swallowed a safety pin in the workplace. Both patients presented  with  neck  discomfort  and  localized  tenderness,  and  plain  X-ray confirmed the presence of the foreign bodies in the upper esophagus. Due to the lack of emergency endoscopy services, surgical intervention under general anesthesia was performed successfully in both instances. A  transverse  cervical  approach  allowed  safe  extraction  of  the  foreign bodies without injury to adjacent structures. Postoperative recovery was uneventful in both patients, with satisfactory outcomes following short periods of nil per oral and antibiotic prophylaxis. This report emphasizes the  urgent  need  for  timely  diagnosis  and  tailored  management approaches in resource-limited settings, where surgical retrieval remains the primary treatment option in the absence of less invasive alternatives.

### Background

Ingestion of a foreign body is a frequent diagnosis that can lead to serious complications. This condition refers to swallowing of a harmful foreign object, whether deliberate,  accidental,  or  unintentional  during  daily  activities. Cases of foreign body ingestion involving the gastrointestinal  tract  are  commonly  encountered  in  emergency departments, with children being the most frequently affected.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> Based on the 2021 Annual American Association  of  Poison  Control  Center  report,  FB  ingestion  in children less than 5 years accounted for approximately 55,000 cases with higher rates observed among boys.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup>

Foreign bodies typically  become  lodged  at  the narrowest anatomical constriction of the gastrointestinal tract-namely, the upper esophagus at the level of the cricoid cartilage.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3</sup> Clinical presentation varies depending on  the  type  and  location  of  the  FB  ingested,  however, common  symptoms  may  include  drooling,  vomiting, dysphagia, and throat or chest pain.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup> Possible complications of Foreign Body ingestion include swelling, bleeding, fistula formation, perforation, cellulitis, mediastinitis, and  abscess  formation.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup>  Prior  to  the  development  of modern surgical and endoscopic techniques, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with the ingestion of sharp objects were reported as 35% and 26%, respectively.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6</sup>

### Case 1

**History and Examination**

An  11-year-old  boy  was  brought  to  the  emergency department within 30 minutes of ingestion of a sewing needle after being dared by his peers to do so. The child was crying due to the pain, however, no history of bleeding from the neck or coughing of blood. General examination revealed a child in distress. Inspection of the neck showed  a  protruding  object  on  the  anterior  aspect (Figure 1).  Lateral  radiograph  of  the  neck  was  obtained and showed the position of the needle, that was oriented antero-posteriorly (Figure 2).

**Management**

The guardian signed an informed consent for an emergency surgery, which was done under general anesthesia  with  an  esophageal  airway.  The  surgical  site  was prepped  using  alcohol-based  chlorhexidine  gluconate solution.  Under  complete  aseptic  precautions,  a  1  cm transverse incision was made on the anterior part of the neck  (skin)  just  below  the  location  of  the  needle.  The incision  was  developed  and  extended  longitudinally through various tissue layers until the tip of the needle was visible. A 3- inch sewing needle was removed from the upper part of the neck with a tissue holding forceps. There  was  no  damage  to  the  adjacent  structures.  This was mainly due to the fact that the needle was conveniently  trapped  by  the  muscle  of  the  esophagus.  The tissues and the skin were closed in layers and via continuous suturing using Vicryl 2.0 along the skin crease. The child made good recovery and was placed on IV 5% D/S and nil per oral for 3 days, before starting oral sips. He was discharged after 4 days with a one week follow-up visit, that was satisfactory.

### Case 2

**History and Examination**

An  18-year-old  woman  was  brought  into  the  Accident and Emergency after 48 hours of ingesting a safety pin. She was a fashion designer who was working and talking whilst the safety pin was in her mouth then she suddenly swallowed  the  pin.  She  presented  with  a  feeling  of foreign  body  sensation  and  sharp  pain  in  her  throat which was not radiating, no history of vomiting but she tried  inducing  one.  No  dysphagia  or  odynophagia.  No difficulty in breathing, choking spells and hoarseness of voice. She had no significant medical or surgical history except  for  chronic  dyspepsia.  Other  than  generalized neck  tenderness,  her  clinical  examination  was  unremarkable, and her vital signs were within normal limits. lateral Radiograph of the neck was taken, it revealed a safety pin in a transverse position (Figure 3).

**Management**

As in Case 1, the surgery was done under General Anesthesia with an oral pharyngeal airway, skin was prepped using  alcohol-based  chlorhexidine  gluconate  solution. Under complete aseptic precautions, a transverse incision was made on the anterior part of the neck (skin) just  below the location of the needle. The incision was developed longitudinally,  taking  care  not  to  injure  any neurovascular  structure,  until  the  safety  pin  was  seen and removed using tissue forceps. The tissues and the skin  were  closed  in  layers  and  via  continuous  suturing using Vicryl 2.0 along the crease of the skin. She made a good recovery and was placed on IV 5% D/S and nil per oral  for  3  days,  before  starting  oral  sips.  She  received Co-amoxiclav 1.2 gms, 12 hourly for 48 hours and Paracetamol 500 mgs 6 hourly for days then PRN. She was discharged  after  6  days  on  admission  with  a  1  week follow-up visit, that was unremarkable.

### Discussion

Most ingested foreign bodies typically pass through the gastrointestinal  (GI)  tract  without  causing  significant symptoms.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup> Upper GI endoscopy is the preferred initial method  for  removing  foreign  bodies  lodged  at  the esophagus and is seen as the safest and most effective approach for both diagnosis and treatment. This minimally  invasive  technique  involves  using  an  endoscope equipped with a camera and instruments to locate and extract  the  foreign  object,  without  open  surgery,  as reported  by  Chaudhari  et  al.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>  However,  the  scarcity  of

emergency endoscopy services in most hospitals poses a great  limitation  in  rural  areas  of  Africa,  including  Nigeria, hence the need for surgical intervention as in this report. Similar observations were published by other authors from Northern Nigeria.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">9</sup>

Certain foreign bodies, particularly sharp metal objects, fish  bones,  or  chemically  reactive  items  such  as  batteries, can  cause  local  tissue  damage,  necrosis,  and  secondary infection. More severe and potentially life-threatening complications  include  mediastinitis,  esophageal  perforation, abscess  formation,  empyema  thoracis,  esophago-aortic fistula, and even death.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10</sup>

The two cases presented in this study are notable due to the  unique  circumstances  surrounding  their  occurrence. Pediatric  patients  often  engage  in  risk-taking  behaviors without  full  awareness  of  the  potential  long-term  consequences, which can be severe. In contrast, adolescents and adults may intentionally or unintentionally ingest harmful substances  or  foreign  bodies,  influenced  by  psychiatric conditions,  suicidal  behavior,  drug  trafficking,  or  occupational  exposures,  as  demonstrated  in  the  workplace  case described. Regardless of the etiology, early recognition and prompt intervention are critical to prevent severe complications associated with delayed presentation and/or management.
