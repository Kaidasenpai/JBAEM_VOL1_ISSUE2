### Abstract

**Background:** Surgical repair has been the standard therapy for superior sinusvenosus atrial septal defect with associated anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Transcatheter closure using covered stents has been introduced more recently as a less invasive alternative, but early experience demonstrated significant risks, particularly related to the inability to  control  precise  stent  positioning  and  the  danger  of  migration  or pulmonary  venous  obstruction.  A  novel  suture-assisted  deployment technique has been proposed to overcome these limitations.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>

**Objectives:** To report our initial two cases of superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect closure using the suture-assisted covered stent technique and pulmonary vein measurement using a catheter across the defect, thus avoiding the transeptal puncture.

**Methods:**  Three  patients  were  elected  for  the  technique;  one  was deemed  not  suitable  due  to  high  pulmonary  venous  pressure  with balloon  occlusion  test.  The  procedures  employed  bilateral  femoral venous access and right internal jugular access with establishment of a veno-venous femoro-jugular rail. Covered CP stent was prepared with a tethering suture and deployed using a two-balloon strategy (initial positioning balloon followed by definitive expansion balloon).

**Results:** Both cases were technically successful, with accurate stent positioning, complete  defect exclusion,  and  unobstructed  pulmonary venous drainage. No procedural or early complications occurred. Early follow-up by echocardiography and X-ray confirmed stable stent position and preserved pulmonary venous flow and complete closure of the SVASD.

**Conclusion:** The simplified technique using the suture-assisted stent and pulmonary vein measurement using direct catheter across the defect, thereby, avoiding the transeptal puncture appears feasible and safe. It allows controlled deployment and reduces the risk of malposition and inadvertently stent embolization. Larger series and longer follow-up are needed to establish long-term outcomes.

### Introduction

Superior sinus venosus atrial septal defects (SVASDs) are an uncommon subtype of ASD and are characteristically associated  with  partial  anomalous  pulmonary  venous connection  (PAPVC),  most  often  involving  right  upper pulmonary venous drainage to the SVC. Surgical repair remains the gold standard with excellent outcomes, but it requires cardiopulmonary bypass and sternotomy and can  be  complicated  by  sinus  node  dysfunction,  SVC obstruction.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup>

In  the  past  decade,  a  transcatheter  strategy  using long covered stents has emerged as a less-invasive alternative  that  excludes  interatrial  communication  while maintaining unobstructed pulmonary venous return to the left atrium. Early experience highlighted important technical limitations with traditional covered-stent technical limitations with traditional covered-stent implantation, mainly deployment instability, difficulties achieving precise  positioning,  and  risks  of  migration,  pulmonary venous compromise, or residual shunt and often prompting adjunctive trans-septal evaluation of pulmonary  venous  patency.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3,4</sup> To  overcome  these  limitations, Hejazi and colleagues, described the temporary suture-holding technique, which enables external control  of  the  covered  stent  during  deployment  and thereby enhances accuracy and stability.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>

Here,  we  report  our  center's  experience  of  superior SVASD closure with PAPVC using suture-assisted covered stent technique and pulmonary vein measurement using a catheter across the defect, thus avoiding the transeptal puncture. This highlights procedural details, early outcomes, and technical considerations.

### Clinical Case and Procedure

Three male patients, aged 10 years (55.7 kg), 5 years (25.5 kg) and 10 years (50 kg), the third case was aborted due to high pulmonary venous pressure after balloon testing, the  other  two  underwent  transcather  superior  sinus venosus atrial  septal  defect  (SVASD).  All  demonstrated right  heart  dilation  on  echocardiography.  Advanced imaging confirmed the diagnosis. They underwent cardiac MRI which showed significant Qp:Qs shunt. Then they underwent  CT  angiography  to  delineate  the  anatomy and the partial anomalous veins. In both cases, anomalous drainage of the right upper pulmonary vein into the superior vena cava was identified (Figure 1).

They subsequently underwent transcatheter closure of the SVASD using the temporary suture-holding technique  originally  introduced  by  Hejazi  and  colleagues, with  pulmonary  vein  measurement  using  a  catheter across the defect, thus avoiding the transeptal puncture.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> The procedural steps are outlined below.

All procedures were performed under general anesthesia  with  transesophageal  echocardiographic  guidance. Vascular access was obtained via bilateral femoral veins and the right internal jugular vein. A femoral-jugular rail was established by advancing a catheter and wire from the femoral vein into the SVC and snaring the wire from the right internal jugular vein.

The procedure was initiated by advancing a non-compliant balloon across the superior sinus venosus defect  and  inflating  it  under  fluoroscopic  and  transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) guidance. A second catheter, an end- and side-hole 5-Fr Judkins, was introduced from the left femoral vein to monitor pulmonary veins, allowing selective injections and continuous pressure monitoring. While using a non-compliant balloon to occlude the SVC. This strategy ensured that balloon inflation effectively occluded  the  interatrial shunt while confirming that pulmonary venous drainage remained  unobstructed  and  redirected  into  the  left atrium without the need for transeptal puncture. Only after these preliminary assessments confirmed suitability for transcatheter closure was  the covered  stent prepared for deployment (Figure 2).

Then, a 10-zig, 6-cm long-covered CP stent was manually crimped onto a non-compliant Atlas balloon with a temporary  suture  looping  through  one  of  its  proximal struts. The stent was advanced over a through-and-through  femoro-jugular  rail  and  deliberately undersized compared with the final superior vena cava (SVC) diameter. Inflation of this 'positioning

Due  to  the  suture  being  exited  through  the  right internal jugular sheath, gentle external traction allowed fine  repositioning  of  the  proximal  stent  edge  either cranially  or  caudally.  This  maneuver  was  particularly valuable  early  migration  toward  the  right  atrium,  as tension  on  the  suture  could  reposition  the  stent  more securely within the SVC, addressing one of the principal limitations of earlier covered-stent techniques.

During this stage, the covered stent was only partially expanded on the balloon and remained fully controlled by the external suture. This configuration left sufficient space  within  the  SVC  to  accommodate  the  end-  and side-hole  Judkin  catheter  alongside  the  balloon  shaft, permitting  continuous  pressure  monitoring  and  selective angiography from the right upper pulmonary vein. In this  way,  we  could  confirm  that  the  partially  deployed stent  did  not  compromise  pulmonary  venous  return, thereby ensuring safety during positioning and eliminating the need for transseptal access (Figure 3).

However, the stent was pushed deep into the RA. **C** Angiogram, after pulling the stent up using the suture, showing the stent in a good position above the azygous vein. **D** Continuous TEE monitoring.

Once angiography and transesophageal  echocardiography  (TEE)  confirmed  appropriate  positioning  and unobstructed pulmonary venous return. A larger high-pressure  non-complaint  balloon,  sized  to  the  full diameter  of  the  SVC,  was  advanced  over  the  rail  and inflated  to  fully  expand  the  covered  stent  and  achieve circumferential apposition. With the stent stabilized by the expanded balloon, the temporary suture was withdrawn by pulling one free end until it slid out of the strut. Because  the  suture  was  looped  rather  than  knotted, removal  was  straightforward  and  did  not  disturb  the stent's  position.  To  optimize  proximal  anchoring,  we used  an  Andra  XXL  bare  Metal  stent  (48  mm)  in  the second  patient,  and  was  deployed  superiorly,  overlapping with the covered stent. Then, the balloon inflations (Z-Med  26  ×  40  mm)  ensured  complete  stabilization. Selective  injections  into  the  RUPV  after  deployment demonstrated unobstructed drainage into the left atrium with no residual shunt.

Final angiography, selective pulmonary venous injections,  and  TEE  confirmed  complete  exclusion  of  the defect,  absence  of  residual  shunt,  and  stable  stent position  without  pulmonary  venous  compromise.  This technique provided precise intraprocedural control, minimized  the  risk  of  migration,  and  reproduced  the strategy originally introduced by Hejazi and colleagues for suture-assisted covered stent deployment (Figure 4).

### Results

Both procedures were technically successful, with accurate  stent  positioning  and  complete  exclusion  of  the sinus venosus defect. Immediate post-deployment angiography and selective right upper pulmonary vein injections  confirmed  unobstructed  pulmonary  venous drainage into the left atrium without residual shunting. Transesophageal echocardiography corroborated these findings,  demonstrating  appropriate  stent  apposition and redirection of pulmonary venous flow (Figure 5).

Both patients were extubated in the catheterization laboratory and transferred to the ward in stable condition.  No  periprocedural  complications  such  as  arrhythmia,  vascular  injury,  or  stent  migration  were  observed. Early  follow-up  with  transthoracic  echocardiography showed  stable  stent  position,  unobstructed  systemic and  pulmonary  venous  return.  Chest  X-ray  showed confirmed stent position (Figure 6).

### Discussion

Surgical  repair  remains  the  gold  standard  for  superior SVASD  with  PAPVC,  with  excellent  long-term  outcomes. However, it  requires  cardiopulmonary  bypass  and  carries potential complications including sinus node dysfunction and SVC narrowing. In recent years,  transcatheter  strategies  employing  long  covered  stents  have  emerged  as  a promising less-invasive alternative. Early experience highlighted  significant  technical  challenges,  particularly  the risk of stent migration, difficulty achieving precise deployment, and concerns regarding pulmonary venous obstruction.  These  limitations  frequently necessitated adjunctive trans-septal puncture to monitor pulmonary venous patency.

The temporary suture-holding technique, first described  by  Hejazi  and  colleagues,  offers  a  simple  but powerful  solution  to  these  challenges.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>  By  maintaining external control of the proximal stent edge, the operator can reposition the device during deployment, mitigating the  risk  of  malposition  or  embolization.  In  addition, leaving the stent partially expanded while still tethered permits  the  simultaneous  use  of  a  pulmonary  venous catheter and the ability of repositioning the stent, ensuring continuous hemodynamic and angiographic assessment without requiring transseptal puncture.

In  our  experience,  this  simplified  method  proved highly  effective,  allowing  controlled  and  reproducible deployment  with  stable  exclusion  of  the  defect  and preservation of pulmonary venous return. The addition of a bare-metal stent proximally in one patient optimized anchoring, illustrating how this approach can be adapted to individual anatomic considerations. Our results are consistent  with  previously  published  reports,  which demonstrate encouraging procedural success and shortterm  outcomes.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>  Nevertheless,  long-term  follow-up  is essential  to  assess  stent  durability,  endothelialization, and the risk of late venous obstruction.

### Conclusion

The suture-assisted covered stent technique provides a feasible  and  safe  method  for  transcatheter  closure  of superior SVASD with PAPVC. In our two pediatric cases, it allowed accurate deployment, effective exclusion of the defect, and preservation of pulmonary venous drainage without complications. While surgical repair remains the gold standard, this approach may represent a reproducible alternative in carefully selected patients in specialized centers. Larger multicenter experience and longer-term  data  are  required  to  establish  its  role  in routine practice.
