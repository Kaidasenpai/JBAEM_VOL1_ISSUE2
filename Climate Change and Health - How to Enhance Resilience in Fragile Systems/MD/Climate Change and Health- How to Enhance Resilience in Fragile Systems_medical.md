
### Abstract

**Background**: Climate change represents one of the most pressing public health challenges of the 21st century, with fragile and conflict-affected contexts experiencing disproportionate impacts. Libya, situated within the  Eastern  Mediterranean  and  North  Africa  climate  hotspot,  faces intensifying  hazards  including  prolonged  droughts,  extreme  heat, desertification, and catastrophic flooding. These environmental stresses converge  with  structural  vulnerabilities-such  as  degraded  infrastructure,  weak  governance,  limited  disease  surveillance,  and  protracted political instability all of which undermine health system resilience.

**Methods**:  This  study  employs  an  integrative  review  of  peer-reviewed literature, gray reports, climate-health datasets, and comparative evidence from the wider MENA region to assess climate-sensitive health outcomes and systemic vulnerabilities in Libya.

**Results**:  Findings  indicate  escalating  risks  of  vector-borne  and  waterborne  diseases,  respiratory  illness  driven  by  deteriorating  air  quality, heat-related morbidity and mortality, food insecurity, and under-recognized  mental  health  consequences.  The  2023  Derna  floods  exemplify the  compounded  effects  of  climate  shocks  and  governance  fragility, highlighting critical deficiencies in preparedness and response. In the light of these findings, this paper advances context-specific adaptation strategies, including development of a National Health Adaptation Plan, investment  in  climate-resilient  infrastructure,  integration  of  mental health  into  emergency  frameworks,  expansion  of  disease  surveillance systems, and mobilization of international climate finance.

**Conclusion**: Strengthening institutional capacity and embedding climate-health priorities into national policy are essential to safeguard public health, promote resilience, and mitigate the destabilizing effects of climate change in fragile health systems.


### Introduction

Climate change has emerged as the most urgent global health threat of the 21st century, manifesting worldwide through immediate and long-term health risks such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, vector-borne disease spread, food and water insecurity, and displaced populations.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1,10</sup>

The  WHO  estimates  climate  change  may  cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths annually between 2030 and 2050, primarily  from  malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup>

These  outcomes  result  from  complex  pathways: rising  temperatures  and  extreme  weather  worsen  air pollution, increasing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. <sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup>

Water  scarcity  and  contamination  increase  risks  of waterborne illnesses like cholera, especially where sanitation is inadequate.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5-7</sup> Climate impacts on agriculture  threaten  food  security,  leading  to  under-nutrition and related health issues.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7-9</sup> Mental  health  is  adversely affected  by  psychological  stress  from  extreme  events, forced displacement, and uncertainty.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10</sup>

The  Eastern  Mediterranean  and  North  Africa  (EMNA) region,  including  Libya,  is  a  climate  hotspot.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11</sup>  By  2020, the  southern  Mediterranean  warmed  approximately 1.5°C  above  pre-industrial  levels,  exceeding  the  global average of 1.0°C.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">12</sup> Projections indicate regional temperatures may rise by 2.2°C by 2040 and up to 4°C by 2100 under high emissions scenarios.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11-13</sup>  Libya is already experiencing intensified hazards such as prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall,  desertification,  and  extreme  weather (Table 1). The 2023 Medicane storm caused catastrophic flooding  in  Derna,  resulting  in  approximately  15,000 deaths and severe infrastructure damage.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">15</sup>

Table 1: Climate Hazards Risk Level Classification in Libya<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">14</sup>

| Hazards        | Risk Levels   |
|----------------|---------------|
| Coastal Flood  | High          |
| Water Scarcity | High          |
| Extreme Heat   | High          |
| Wildfire       | High          |
| Wadi Flood     | Medium        |
| Tsunami        | Medium        |
| Urban Flood    | Low           |
| Earthquake     | Low           |
| Landslide      | Very Low      |
| Volcano        | Very Low      |

These environmental stresses compound  Libya's structural vulnerabilities: &gt;95% desert terrain, &lt;1% arable land,  and  dependence  on  the  Man-Made  River  which makes up over 60% of the freshwater supply, threatened by overuse and contamination.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">16</sup>Libya imports over 75% of  its  food,  increasing  susceptibility  to  global  supply disruptions exacerbated  by climate events.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">16</sup> Libya's healthcare system, weakened by prolonged conflict and political instability, is ill-prepared for rising climate-sensitive  health  threats.  Many  facilities  lack  adequate  infrastructure, equipment, and personnel.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup> The absence of a unified  health  information  system  and  limited  disease surveillance  hinder  timely  responses.  Less  than  25%  of the population has access to safe sanitation, exacerbating public health risks.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">16</sup>

Despite  growing  global  attention  to  climate  and health,  Libya  remains  underrepresented  in  scientific literature.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5,16</sup>  Most  regional  studies  emphasize  environmental  impacts  or  focus  on  relatively  stable  countries like  Egypt,  Tunisia,  or  Morocco.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11</sup>  This  gap  limits  policymakers'  ability  to  develop  targeted,  evidence-based adaptation strategies.

This study addresses these gaps by synthesizing evidence on climate-related health outcomes, evaluating  Libya's  health  system  vulnerability  and  resilience, and proposing context-specific adaptation and mitigation  strategies.  It  examines  pathways  linking  climate drivers to health challenges-including infectious diseases, heat-related illnesses, respiratory conditions, malnutrition, and  mental  health  actionable strategies to enhance  system-wide  resilience. By situating Libya within the broader regional and global climate-health discourse, this research aims to support evidence-based policy planning and strengthen public health preparedness  in  one  of  the  world's  most  climate-vulnerable contexts.

### Methods

A structured integrative review methodology was employed,  following  the  IMRAD  framework.  Due  to limited  country-specific  data  and  research,  the  review synthesized peer-reviewed literature, gray literature, policy documents, and climate-health datasets, supplemented by evidence from comparable arid and conflict-affected countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

Inclusion  Criteria:  Studies  addressing  climate-sensitive health outcomes (vector-borne diseases, heat illnesses, waterborne  infections),  environmental  risks  (drought, floods, desertification), and health system responses in arid or conflict-affected settings, particularly North Africa.

Exclusion  Criteria:  Studies  unrelated  to  human  health, duplicates, non-English/Arabic publications without translations,  and  research  solely  on  economic/agricultural modeling lacking public health relevance.

Due  to  Libya's  limited  health  surveillance  capacity and conflict-related constraints, evidence from Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria was used to infer potential health trends.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5,16</sup>  Additional  data  from  sub-national sources,  NGOs,  and  humanitarian  assessments  were incorporated,  though  many  lacked  systematic  health indicators or climate-health disaggregation.

Quantitative data scarcity precluded formal statistical analysis. A qualitative thematic synthesis was conducted across six domains: infectious diseases, heat stress and extreme weather, respiratory health, nutrition and  food  security,  mental  health,  and  health  system infrastructure  and  resilience.  Climate  data-including temperature trends and projections-were sourced from Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) reports,  NASA,  ECMWF,  and  the  World  Bank.  WHO climate  and  health  country  profiles  and  climate  risk indices contextualized Libya's vulnerabilities.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3,4-6</sup>

This integrative approach  consolidated scientific evidence, policy perspectives, and climate-health indicators,  providing  the  most  comprehensive  assessment  feasible  under  Libya's  data  constraints.  Findings aim to inform national climate adaptation planning and strengthen public health resilience in climate-vulnerable, conflict-affected settings.

### Results

**Water Scarcity and Health Implications**

Libya's reliance on non-renewable fossil aquifers via the Man-Made  River  is undermined  by  over-extraction, contamination, and prolonged droughts, reducing

water  availability  and  hygiene,  increasing  dependence on unsafe water sources, contributing to cholera, dysentery, and giardiasis outbreaks, especially in under-served and displaced populations. Flood-related sewage overflows  during  the  2023  Derna  flood  exacerbated waterborne disease transmission. Other high-risk areas-Ghat, Kufra, and Zliten-face elevated cholera risk due to rising groundwater levels. Migrant influxes from sub-Saharan  Africa  further  strain  water  and  sanitation systems, increasing outbreak vulnerability.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5,15,16</sup>

**Air Pollution and Respiratory Disease**

Libya's  air  quality  has  deteriorated  due  to  frequent sand-storms,  unregulated  industrial  emissions,  waste burning,  and  the  increased  use  of  diesel  generators during  power  outages.  Fine  particulate  matter  (PM₂.₅  / PM₁₀) and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations regularly exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality  guidelines.  In  2023,  Libya's  average  PM₂.₅  concentration (~30 µg/m³) was approximately six times higher than the  WHO  guideline  value  of  5  µg/m³.¹⁷  Saharan  dust intensified by desertification contributes significantly to respiratory illness. A 2017 dust storm in Tripoli and a 2021 sandstorm in Benghazi were linked to spikes in pediatric asthma admissions.

Chronic  exposure  correlates  with  rising  bronchitis and  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (COPD) rates.  Air  pollution  accounted  for  11%  of  all  deaths  in 2016,  causing  an  estimated  41-59  deaths  per  100,000 population.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">17-19</sup>

**Heatwaves and Mortality Risk**

Heatwaves have intensified, with summer temperatures often  exceeding  45°C.  Projections  estimate  an  average temperature  rise  of  +1.42°C  by  2060,  pushing  annual means  to  25.6°C.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">20</sup>  The  2022  Tripoli  heatwave  (48°C) highlighted data gaps, as the lack of sensitive mortality surveillance  precluded  assessment  of  excess  deaths. Vulnerable  populations-elderly,  outdoor  workers,  and those  without  cooling-are  disproportionately  affected. Regional models estimate 500-1,500 annual heat-related deaths in Libya, mirroring Algeria's experience.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">21</sup> Heat exacerbates  pre-existing  respiratory  and  cardiovascular conditions.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">22,23</sup>

**Extreme  Weather  Events  and  Disaster-Related  Health Burdens**

Climate-related disasters have surged in frequency and severity. The 2023 Medicane in Derna caused thousands of deaths, displacement, and infrastructure destruction. The 2024 Tarhuna floods damaged hospitals and caused fatalities among emergency personnel. Disrupted medical  supply  chains  and  facility  closures  delayed  care.  By 2050, Libya is expected to experience a 7% reduction in average annual precipitation, increasing flash flood risks in urban and rural areas.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">20</sup>These events magnify injury, disease  outbreaks,  and  mental  trauma  risks,  especially where emergency preparedness is weak.

**Health System Challenges**

Libya's  healthcare  system is  strained  by  climate  shocks and longstanding vulnerabilities including conflict-driven destruction, governance fragmentation, and chronic underinvestment. Key vulnerabilities include:

1. Fragile Infrastructure and Workforce Shortages: Conflict and extreme weather have degraded facilities, causing unreliable electricity and water supply, compromising care continuity. Floods forced clinic closures and hospital incapacitation, delaying trauma care for thousands. Medical workforce shortages persist, with doctor-to-population ratios below WHO  benchmarks, particularly in underserved regions.  Energy  demands  forcooling  strain  power systems, causing outages that disrupt services and equipment maintenance⁵.
2.    Weak Surveillance and Early Warning: Libya lacks a comprehensive electronic disease surveillance system. Fragmented efforts impede outbreak detec tion and response, as seen after Derna floods with untracked diarrheal disease surges. Early warning systems for climate-sensitive diseases and extreme weather are absent or nonfunctional.

**Governance Fragmentation and Financial Constraints**

Political  instability  and  overlapping  authorities  hinder coordinated  health  governance.  Climate  and  health remain  low  policy  priorities.  Preparedness  is  largely reactive,  with  limited  heat-health  plans,  disaster  management  protocols,  and  risk-oriented  communication. Budget  constraints  limit  investments  in  resilient  infrastructure,  workforce  training,  and  health-information systems.  Flood-damaged  transport  networks  disrupt medicine and vaccine delivery.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> Although some activities are underway with international partners, Libya lacks an operational  Health  National  Adaptation  Plan  (HNAP) and  political  divisions  continue  to  stall  climate-health preparedness.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

### Discussion

This study highlights the urgent, multidimensional threat climate change poses to public health in Libya, a nation facing environmental fragility, political instability, and  a  strained  healthcare  system.  Findings  align  with global  and  regional  trends  showing  climate  change disproportionately impacts low-resource, conflict-affected  settings.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1,4</sup>  Rising  temperatures,  reduced  precipitation, and extreme weather compound health disparities and strain fragile health infrastructure.

Comparative evidence from the MENA region reinforces these observations. Egypt and Tunisia report increased respiratory  illness  and  heat-related  mortality linked  to  deteriorating  air  quality  and  rising  temperatures. Unlike Libya, these countries have  launched National Health Adaptation Plans and integrated early warning  systems,  mitigating  some  climate  impacts. Libya's  fragmented  governance  and  lack  of  preparedness exacerbate health consequences of similar stressors.

Post-flood disease outbreaks in Derna illustrate the cost  of  inaction.  Globally,  waterborne  disease  spikes following  extreme  weather  are  well  documented,  yet Libya  lacks  contingency  plans  and  ecological  monitoring.  Reports  of  increased  scorpion  stings  in  southern Tunisia due to ecological shifts raise concerns for similar unmonitored risks in Libya.

The 2003 European heatwave, causing over 70,000 excess deaths, demonstrates the value of preparedness measures  like  early  warning  systems  and  heat-health action plans.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">24</sup> Jordan and Egypt's climate-resilient

healthcare  infrastructure  and  green  hospital  initiatives offer viable models for Libya.

Climate-related health threats in Libya mirror global risks. Vector-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya  have  expanded  in  neighboring  Egypt  and  Sudan, consistent with  IPCC and WHO warnings that  arid-region  populations  face  heightened  outbreak  risks.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">15,25,26</sup> Mental health impacts are significant but under investigated. The 2023 Derna flood triggered acute psychological trauma and climate-related anxiety. Although Libya recently  established  a  National  Authority  for  Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, integration of mental health into climate adaptation remains minimal. Mental health  and  psychosocial  support  must  become  core components of public health emergency responses.

for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, integration of mental health into climate adaptation remains minimal of mental health into climate adaptation remains minimal.

More than a decade of conflict has left Libya's health facilities  understaffed and under-resourced. Attacks on infrastructure and exodus of foreign medical personnel have eroded the capacity of the health system.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">27</sup> Lower development health information systems hinder disease surveillance  and  response.  With  less  than  25%  of  the population  accessing  safe  sanitation,  vulnerability  to waterborne diseases is compounded.

Climate change amplifies these systemic weaknesses. The 2023 Medicane flood exposed consequences of unregulated  urban  growth,  aging  infrastructure,  and weak disaster preparedness. Without proactive adaptation, each  climate  shock  risks further destabilizing Libya's public health system and fules politcal development.

### Conclusion

This  study  provides  the  first  integrated  assessment  of climate change's public health impacts in Libya. Rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, and extreme weather  events  contribute  to  a  growing  burden  of climate-sensitive health conditions, including heat-related mortality, respiratory and vector-borne diseases, and food and water insecurity. These patterns reflect global trends but are particularly acute in Libya due to its arid climate, fragile infrastructure, and political instability.

Systemic vulnerabilities-including damaged health infrastructure,  workforce  shortages,  inadequate  surveillance,  and  fragmented  governance-undermine Libya's capacity to respond. Without urgent adaptation efforts, these challenges will escalate, threatening public health and development goals.

Despite data limitations, findings highlight the urgent need to integrate climate resilience into national health planning by strengthening institutional capacity, expanding electronic surveillance, upgrading infrastructure, and embedding climate-health priorities in policy and budgeting. Context-specific, evidence-based reforms, combined with regional cooperation and international support, can lay the foundation for a climate-resilient,  equitable  healthcare  system  in  Libya.  Decisive leadership and sustained commitment are essential. The time for action is now (Table 2 and Table 3).
