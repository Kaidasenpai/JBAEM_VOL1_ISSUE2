
Effective postoperative pain management begins with accurate assessment. Yet, despite pain being widely recognized as the 'fifth vital sign,' significant disparities  persist  in  how  it  is  measured  and  managed  across  linguistic  and  cultural contexts.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>  The  recent  translation  and  validation  of  the  American  Pain  Society Patient  Outcome  Questionnaire-Revised  (APS-POQ-R)  into  Arabic  marks  an important advancement in addressing these gaps for Arabic-speaking patients.

The  APS-POQ-R  is  a  well-established  tool  designed  to  evaluate  multiple dimensions of pain-severity, relief, emotional impact, interference with function and sleepP, and patient participation in care.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup> Until now, the lack of a validated Arabic  version  limited  its  use  across  22  Arabic-speaking  countries,  hindering both clinical quality assessment and cross-cultural research.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3</sup>

The study reported in this issue of the Journal of the Best Available Evidence in  Medicine employed a methodologically rigorous process in translating and validating the instrument.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup> Following international guidelines, the team conducted forward and backward translation, expert panel reconciliation, pilot cognitive testing, and psychometric evaluation with 150 postoperative patients in  Libya.  The  Arabic  APS-POQ-R  demonstrated  excellent  internal  consistency (Cronbach's α =  0.90),  mirroring the reliability of the original English version.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1,3</sup> Participants  confirmed  that  the  instrument  was  clear,  culturally  relevant,  and easy to understand.

Beyond linguistic validation, this achievement has significant clinical implications.  Reliable  pain  outcome  measurement  enables  healthcare  providers  to identify inadequacies in pain control, tailor interventions, and engage patients in shared decision-making.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3,4</sup> Importantly, data from the study revealed that over half  of  the  participants  continued  to  experience  moderate-to-severe  pain  24 hours post-surgery-a reminder that effective assessment is only the first step toward better management.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3-5</sup>

The  availability  of  a  validated  Arabic  APS-POQ-R  provides  clinicians  and researchers with a standardized, culturally appropriate tool for evaluating pain outcomes.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1,3</sup> Its  use  can  enhance  quality  improvement  programs,  support benchmarking  across  hospitals,  and  expand  inclusion  of  Arabic-speaking patients in global pain research.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4,5</sup>

Future  work  should  explore  adaptation  across  regional  dialects,  assess responsiveness to clinical change, and integrate the questionnaire into digital health systems. Such initiatives will help translate validated measurement into tangible improvements in patient care.

The Arabic validation of the APS-POQ-R represents more than a linguistic milestone-it is a step toward equitable, evidence-based pain management for millions of Arabic-speaking patients. By combining methodological rigor with cultural sensitivity, this work strengthens the foundation for better pain assessment, research collaboration, and ultimately, better outcomes for patients recovering from surgery.
