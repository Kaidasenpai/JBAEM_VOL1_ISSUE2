### Abstract

**Background:** Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding protein, IGFBP-3, are crucial mediators of childhood growth and development. Alterations  in  their  serum  levels  have  been  implicated  in  congenital heart disease (CHD), especially in relation to chronic hypoxia and growth failure.

**Aim:** To evaluate serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in children with CHD, to compare variations between cyanotic and acyanotic subtypes, and to explore correlations with anthropometric and clinical parameters.

**Methods:**  A  cross-sectional  comparative  study  was  conducted  on  82 children aged 2 months to 5 years: Group 1 (cyanotic CHD, n=12), Group 2 (acyanotic CHD, n=30), and Group 3 (control group, n=40). Serum IGF-1 and  IGFBP-3  were  measured  using  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Pearson's correlation tests.

**Results:**  Children  with  congenital  heart  disease  showed  significant growth deficits compared with healthy controls. Both Group 1 (cyanotic CHD) and Group 2 (acyanotic CHD) demonstrated markedly lower mean weight,  height,  and  head  circumference  than  Group  3  (controls)  (p  &lt; 0.01). Serum biomarker analysis revealed that IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were significantly reduced in both CHD groups relative to controls (p &lt; 0.001), with the lowest concentrations observed in Group 1. These findings indicate that growth impairment and suppression of the IGF axis are  most  severe  in  cyanotic  CHD,  highlighting  the  potential  role  of chronic hypoxia in mediating growth factor dysregulation.

**Conclusion:** Chronic hypoxia in cyanotic CHD may downregulate hepatic growth hormone receptors, suppressing IGF-1 synthesis. These biomarkers may help stratify nutritional and metabolic risk in paediatric CHD.


### Introduction

Congenital heart disease (CHD) encompasses a diverse group of structural and functional heart defects present at birth and remains among the most common congenital anomalies worldwide.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> The global prevalence of CHD is  estimated  at  approximately  1%  among  live  births, representing a persistent public health challenge.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup> While advances in  diagnosis  and  intervention  have  markedly improved  survival  rates,  affected  children  continue  to face complications such as growth deficits and increased  perioperative  morbidity.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3-5</sup> These  risks are particularly pronounced in cyanotic CHD where chronic hypoxia imposes additional metabolic and cellular stress.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4-6</sup>

Beyond  growth  regulation,  the  insulin-like  growth factor (IGF) axis plays a crucial role in myocardial contractility,  endothelial  repair,  and  angiogenesis.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6,7</sup> Chronic hypoxia  may  downregulate  hepatic  growth  hormone receptors and blunt IGF-1 synthesis, thereby contributing to growth failure and impaired cardiac tissue recovery.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8,9</sup> Recent  studies  in  cardiology  and  endocrinology  have underscored the interplay between IGF-1/IGFBP-3 signalling and  myocardial  function  in  paediatric  CHD.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10,11</sup> Despite  numerous  reports  documenting  growth  retardation in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), there  remains  a  notable  paucity  of  studies  that  have systematically evaluated serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels across distinct CHD phenotypes within paediatric populations  from  developing  countries.  This  study  aims  to address this critical gap by comprehensively investigating the serum profiles of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 among Egyptian  children  diagnosed  with  CHD,  comparing  them with age- and sex-matched healthy controls possessing structurally normal hearts. Furthermore, the study correlates these biomarker patterns with contemporary molecular and clinical findings reported in recent literature, elucidating the impact of hypoxia and malnutrition on growth factor regulation in this population.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11-14</sup>

## Subjects and Methods

This  cross-sectional  comparative  study  was  conducted at Alexandria University Children's Hospital. 42 children with CHD (Group 1: cyanotic CHD, n=12; Group 2: acyanotic  CHD,  n=30)  and  40,  age-  and  sex-matched  healthy controls (Group 3). All patients underwent 2-D Echocardiography to confirm or rule out structural CHD. Children with genetic syndromes, endocrine disorders, or recent major illness were not included in the study. Weight and height  were  recorded,  and  WHO  z-scores  calculated. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulse oximetry at rest as an indicator of disease severity. Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured using ELISA. Lesion stratification included VSD, ASD, and PDA for Group 2, and TOF and TGA for Group 1. Medication history and recent nutritional interventions were reviewed to exclude potential confounders.

Data was analysed using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Normally distributed data were expressed as mean ± SD and compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's  post-hoc  test.  Non-normally  distributed  data were expressed as median (IQR) and analysed with the Kruskal-Wallis.  Categorical  variables  were  compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.  The  F-values  shown  in  Table  2  correspond  to  the ANOVA test statistics for group comparisons of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Pairwise comparisons are denoted as follows; p₁: Group 1 (Cyanotic CHD) vs. Group 2 (Acyanotic CHD), p₂: Group 1 vs. Control, p₃: Group 2 vs. Control. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and values &lt; 0.001 were reported as p &lt; 0.001.

### Results

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics:

Of the 42 CHD patients, 28.6% were in Group 1 and 71.4% were in Group 2. Group 1 cases were dominated by transposition of the great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot. The leading diagnoses in Group 2 were VSD, ASD, and PDA. Anthropometric  measurements  (weight,  height,  and head circumference) were significantly lower in Group 1 and Group 2 compared to Group 3 (p &lt; 0.01) (Table 1).

Biomarker  Results:  IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  were  significantly lower in Group 1 and Group 2 versus Group 3 (p &lt; 0.001), with Group 1 showing the lowest values. Cyanotic lesions, especially TOF and TGA, demonstrated the most pronounced  suppression  of  IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  compared with Group 2 (Table 2). IGF-1 correlated positively with SpO2 and with weight-for-age z-scores. Both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 demonstrated significant positive correlations with oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and weight-for-age z-scores  (p  &lt;  0.05),  underscoring  the  role  of  chronic hypoxia  as  a  key  driver  of  growth  axis  suppression  in cyanotic congenital heart disease (Table 2).

### Discussion

The study demonstrates substantial reductions in serum IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  levels  in  children  with  CHD,  most pronounced in Group 1 (cyanotic CHD). These findings support a direct pathophysiological link between chronic  hypoxia  and  suppression  of  the  IGF  axis.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4,5,7</sup> IGF-1 deficiency may limit cardiomyocyte proliferation, mitochondrial resilience,  and  endothelial  repair,  potentially delaying postoperative recovery and growth catch-up.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4,5,7,15</sup>

Our results are consistent with international cohorts that  reported  IGF-axis  suppression  in  similar  chort  of patients.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">9,11,15</sup> Chronic  hypoxia  downregulates  growth hormone receptor signalling and hepatic IGF-1 synthesis through HIF-1-mediated transcriptional repression, which  may  explain  the  markedly  reduced  IGF-1  and IGFBP-3 concentrations observed in Group 1.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7,9</sup>

From a clinical perspective, IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  may serve as adjunctive prognostic biomarkers to aid growth assessment and perioperative risk stratification in paediatric CHD.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4-6,14-16</sup> Their integration into preoperative evaluation could complement anthropometry and oxygen saturation monitoring, especially in resource-limited settings.

### Conclusion

Children  with  congenital  heart  disease  exhibit  significantly reduced serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 compared with healthy controls, with the lowest concentrations observed in Group 1 (cyanotic CHD). These findings support the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia suppresses the  GH-IGF  axis,  contributing  to  growth  failure  and developmental  delay  in  affected  children.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4,5,8,9</sup> Both IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  demonstrate  strong  potential  as biochemical  indicators  of  disease  severity  and  growth impairment.  Their  assessment  could  help  clinicians better understand the metabolic consequences  of hypoxia and improve preoperative evaluation and nutritional  management  strategies.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5,8</sup> Further  studies  with larger cohorts may establish IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 as clinical markers  for  growth  monitoring  and  preoperative  risk assessment in children with congenital heart disease.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">14,15,17</sup>

### Limitations

This study is limited by its single-centre cross-sectional design and modest sample size. The lack of comprehensive endocrine and nutritional profiling may have influenced biomarker levels.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4,5,14</sup> In addition, residual confounding from unmeasured nutritional or endocrine variables cannot be fully excluded. A multicentre longitudinal study is recommended to validate the prognostic utility of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in paediatric CHD.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">15,17,18</sup>
