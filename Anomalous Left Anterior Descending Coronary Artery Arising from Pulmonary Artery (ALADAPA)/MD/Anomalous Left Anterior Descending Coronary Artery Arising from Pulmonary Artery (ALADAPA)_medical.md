### Abstract

**Background**: Congenital coronary artery abnormalities are detected in 0.6  to  1%  of  adult  patients  having  coronary  angiography.  Anomalous origin of coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly that is almost always lethal if not diagnosed and treated. Only 51 cases of ALADAPA have been reported in the literature, with clinical presentations varying from sudden cardiac arrest to incidental murmur depending on the area of the myocardium affected.

**Case Presentation**: A 32-year-old female who presented with unstable angina  was  diagnosed  with  an  anomalous  origin  of  the  left  anterior descending artery from the pulmonary artery (ALADAPA). The patient underwent  uneventful  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting  where  the  left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and the abnormal origin of ALDAPA was ligated. The patient's symptoms improved remarkably. Computerized tomography coronary angiography performed six weeks postoperatively showed patent LIMA to LAD.

**Conclusion**:  LIMA to ALDAPA can be performed successfully with excellent short-term results. Reporting these rare conditions to cardiologists and cardiac  surgeons  will  provide  further  insights  into  their  management.


### Background

Normal  coronary  artery  distribution  includes  the  right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and the left coronary artery (LCA) arising from the left aortic sinus of Valsalva.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup>

Congenital coronary artery abnormalities are detected  in  0.6  to  1%  of  adult  patients  undergoing  coronary angiography.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup>  Anomalous  origin  of  coronary  arteries from the pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly that is almost always lethal if not diagnosed and treated. Of  these  anomalous  left  main  coronary  artery  from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is the most common anomaly  with  an  incidence  of  1  in  30,000  to  1  in  300,000 people.  Other  variants  are  extremely  rare  including anomalous LAD (ALADAPA), circumflex and RCA.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3,4</sup>

Only 51 cases of ALADAPA have been reported in the literature, with clinical presentations varying from sudden cardiac arrest to an incidental murmur depending on the myocardial territory affected.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup>

### Case Presentation

This is a 32-year-old female patient who complained of typical  chest  pain  at  rest  (unstable  angina,  Canadian cardiovascular  society  class  IV).  No  previous  history  of chronic illnesses and no known family history of coronary or congenital cardiac diseases. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a soft systolic murmur over the left parasternal area. Her laboratory investigations were within  the  normal  range.  Resting  electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show any specific changes, and exercise ECG was positive for ischemia. Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular function (LVF) with no valve abnormalities.

Percutaneous coronary angiography showed a large dominant, ectatic and tortuous RCA vessel, with numerous large collaterals to the LAD shunting to the PA. LMCA origin  was  normal  and  bifurcating  into  left  circumflex (L.Cx) and small proximal LAD stump. The LAD was also dilated  and  abnormally  originating  from  the  main  PA trunk.
Computerized  tomography  coronary  angiography (CTCA)  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  anomalous  LAD arising from the PA with normal origins of RCA and L.Cx. (Figure 1 a,b). The case was discussed by the cardiac team and a decision was taken to perform LIMA-to-LAD and disconnect the abnormal origin of LAD from the PA.

Through median sternotomy, the left internal mammary artery was harvested, followed by full heparinization  and  commencement  of  cardiopulmonary  bypass. The operative findings confirmed large ectatic LAD (3-4 mm)  arising  from  the  left  lateral  aspect  of  the  main pulmonary artery trunk with palpable thrill over the PA (Figure 2). The RCA was large and tortuous giving numerous large collaterals to LAD.

Trial of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was  aborted  due  to  torrential  collateral  flow  which rendered  visibility  extremely  difficult  and  necessitated conversion  to  on-pump,  beating  heart  LIMA-to-LAD anastomis, that was performed using 7-0 Prolene (Figure 3).

The  origin  of  LAD  from  PA  was  ligated  using  double armed 3-0  proline  stitches.  Weaning  from  bypass  was very  smooth  and  standard  closure  was  completed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.

One month later, on the 1st  postoperative  visit,  the patient  reported  marked  improvement  of  symptoms with  no  angina  at  all.  CTCA  was  done  6  weeks  after surgery and showed patent LIMA to LAD with good distal run off and no shunt to PA (Figure 4 a and b).

### Discussion

Anomalous coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery is a rare but serious congenital cardiac anomaly. Without  surgery,  approximately  85%  of  patients  die before reaching adulthood.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup>

In a systematic review conducted in 2019, 51 cases of ALADAPA were described with mean age 27.3 years with female predominance. Clinical presentation was variable ranging from angina, as in this patient, to palpitations and heart failure. Fatigue and fever were reported as incidental findings in a few cases (approximately 10%) and sudden cardiac death was reported in three cases.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup> The development of symptoms depends on the degree of collateralization. Initial collateralization is essential for survival to adulthood.

However,  as  collaterals become  larger  with  less resistance, they create a steal syndrome from the area of supply and shunt significantly to the pulmonary artery. Conventionally,  ALCAPA  and  similar  anomalies  have been diagnosed by autopsy or contrast echocardiography. Both invasive coronary angiography and non-invasive coronary CTA are considered equivalent and are the main diagnostic methods in today's practice. Magnetic resonance  imaging  can  provide  the  same  data  as  CT with the added benefit of myocardial perfusion.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6</sup> Additionally, short LAD originating from the aorta terminating  early  in  the  interventricular  groove  creating  'Dual LAD 'pattern have been reported by CT studies.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup>

Surgical  correction  should  be  considered  even  in asymptomatic  cases  given  the  risk  of  sudden  death. Re-implantation of LAD button onto the aorta may be considered as a treatment option.

However, LIMA to LAD with proximal ligation of the anomalous artery  is  an  accepted  alternative  whenever transfer  is  not  feasible  in  certain  cases  such  as  deeply buried proximal LAD or originating from the far lateral side of the PA.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

Left  internal  mammary  artery  (LIMA)  is  traditionally preferred although no long-term data comparing it to the vein are available in this category of patients. In one case report the anomalous LAD was using a saphenous vein  graft  with  a  follow  up  angiography  performed  3 years  later,  revealing  a  patent  venous  graft  and  regression  of  collaterals.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">9</sup>  Simple  ligation  of  the  anomalous vessel  will  abolish  the  shunt  but  will  leave  extensive collaterals intact, creating a dead space in the coronary circulation with a risk of future occlusion and ischemia.

Other  reported  techniques  include  intrapulmonary tunnel repair (Takeuchi repair) which carries the risk of tunnel occlusion and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10</sup> Furthermore, the use of 8 mm Dacron tube graft interposed between LAD and aorta due to failed mobilization of LAD button was reported. The patient was asymptomatic postoperatively, but unfortunately the graft showed stenosis on coronary CT-angiography on follow up.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11</sup>

### Conclusion

This is a report of the 52nd case of ALADAPA worldwide treated by direct LIMA to LAD with excellent short-term results. Reporting successful surgery for these rare cases to  cardiologists  and  cardiac  surgeons  provides  further insights into their management.
