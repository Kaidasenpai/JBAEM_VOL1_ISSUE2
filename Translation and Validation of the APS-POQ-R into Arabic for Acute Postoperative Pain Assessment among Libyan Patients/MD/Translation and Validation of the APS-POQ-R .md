### Abstract

**Background:** Effective assessment of acute postoperative pain is essential for optimising postoperative outcomes. The American Pain Society Patient Outcome  Questionnaire-Revised (APS-POQ-R) is a widely recognised instrument for evaluating the quality of postoperative pain managment, yet its use among Arabic-speaking patients remains limited  by  the  lack  of  a  validated  translation.  The  present  study  aimed  to systematically translate and validate the APS-POQ-R  for use in Arabic-speaking surgical populations, following international guidelines for instrument adaptation.

**Methods:** The original English APS-POQ-R underwent a rigorous translation  process  encompassing  independent  forward  translation  by  two native Arabic speakers, reconciliation by a bilingual expert panel, backward translation by independent translators, and review by a multidisciplinary committee. The pre-final Arabic version was pilot-tested with 16 post-abdominal surgery patients using cognitive interviews and debriefing to ensure clarity and cultural relevance. A prospective, cross-sectional  validation  was  conducted  involving  150  adult  patients  in  a  Libyan tertiary care setting. Statistical validation included assessment of internal  consistency  using  Cronbach's  alpha  and  evaluation  of  construct validity.

**Results:** The translation process resulted in a semantically and culturally relevant Arabic version of the APS-POQ-R, requiring no major modifications  after  cognitive  debriefing.  The  internal  consistency  of  the  Arabic instrument was excellent, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90, mirroring the reliability of the original English version. All participants demonstrated clear comprehension  and  appropriate responses, indicating high acceptability and usability of the adapted tool. There were no gaps identified  in  translation  integrity  or  actionable  feedback  necessitating revision.

**Conclusion:** The proposed Arabic translation of the APS-POQ-R is a valid and  reliable  instrument  for  evaluating  patient-reported  outcomes  in acute postoperative pain assessment among Arabic-speaking populations. Its implementation will facilitate standardised assessment, enhance postoperative pain management protocols, and support related research.

### Background

Acute  postoperative  pain  is  one  of  the  most  common challenges following surgery.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> Inadequate pain management can delay recovery, increase morbidity, and contribute  to  chronic  pain  and  opioid  dependence, ultimately leading to patient dissatisfaction and higher healthcare costs.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,3</sup> Accurate assessment of severe acute postoperative pain is essential for effective pain management.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4-6</sup> Consequently, the American Pain Society developed  a  quality  assurance  questionnaire  to  aid  in  the evaluation of acute pain management.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup> 

The American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire-Revised (APS-POQ-R) provides a multidimensional assessment of pain management quality, encompassing pain severity, pain relief, interference with activities and sleep, emotional impact, side effects, informational support, patient engagement in decision-making, as well as utilisation of non-pharmacological strategies.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup>  This instrument has demonstrated strong internal consistency  and  is  widely  recommended  for  assessing pain among medical and surgical patients. However, its use in Arabic-speaking populations has been limited by the  absence  of  a  validated  translation.  Therefore,  this study aimed to translate and validate the APS-POQ-R for use in Arabic-speaking surgical populations.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup> 

### Methodology

This prospective study was conducted over five months following ethical approval from the Ethics Committee at the College of Medical Technology, Derna, Libya. As the survey posed minimal risk and was anonymous, written consent was not required.

The English version of the APS-POQ-R consists of 23 multiple-choice  items  and  an  11-point  Likert  scale.  Of these,  18  questions  are  rated  using  a  numerical  rating scale (NRS).

The  APS-POQ-R  was  translated  into  Arabic  and checked  using  the  back  translation  process,  and  a linguistic specialist was employed to confirm the accuracy  of  the  translation.  Additionally,  the  translation  was completed in accordance with the requirements provided by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).6 The process comprised eight steps:

#### Forward Translation

Two  bilingual  translators,  both  native  Arabic  speakers fluent in English, independently translated the APS-POQ-R  into  Arabic.  One  translator,  a  doctor,  was familiar  with  the  questionnaire's  concepts,  while  the other was not. Each translator then prepared their separate report. A linguistic specialist verified the accuracy of both translations. This approach is well recognised, as it is commonly  used  when  translating  survey  instruments. Only minor changes were required after comparison.

#### Reconciliation

A bilingual expert panel, including the authors, reviewed and  compared  the  two  forward  translations  with  the original  questionnaire.  Discrepancies  were  resolved  to produce a harmonised Arabic version.

#### Backward Translation

The reconciled Arabic version was independently back-translated into English by two bilingual translators. One  translator  was  knowledgeable  about  the  instrument, while the other was naïve to its content. This step was essential to ensure conceptual equivalence with the original version.

#### Preliminary Translation and Proofreading

A  draft  version  was  produced  after  team  discussions involving the primary author. All forward and backward translations were reviewed to finalise the pre-test Arabic questionnaire.

#### Pilot Study

In  accordance  with  EORTC  guidelines,  the  pre-final Arabic version was  administered  to 16 consenting, literate  abdominal  surgery  patients.6  During  the  pilot phase,  the  pre-final  Arabic  version  of  the  APS-POQ-R was  administered  to  assess  clarity,  cultural  relevance, and item comprehension. All 16 participants completed cognitive interviews and debriefing sessions confirmed that all items were clearly understood and appropriately interpreted, with no substantive difficulties or ambiguities in the translated content.

#### Statistical Analysis

Data  were  analysed  using  SPSS.  Internal  consistency reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha, where α ≥ 0.70 considered acceptable and α ≥ 0.90 indicating excellent reliability. Given the single-administration design,  inter-rater  and  test-retest  reliability  were  not assessed.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup> The psychometric features of the APS-POQ-R in  Arabic  were  reported;  test-retest  reliability  in  this questionnaire (Arabic version) was reported as r &gt; 0.80, and internal consistency reliability for the overall APS-POQ-R scales for participants was stated as α = 0.90, which  indicates  excellent.  Using  a  validated  questionnaire, like the APS-POQ-R, would enhance internal validity.

#### Revision

With a Cronbach's Alpha value of 0.90, as specified in the  statistical  analysis  step,  the  first  translated  Arabic questionnaire was deemed to have great internal consistency,  meaning  that  no  additional  modifications  were required (Appendix A).

#### Survey Administration and Finalisation

After  confirming  the  pilot  version's  acceptability  and validating  the  statistical  analysis,  the  translation  was approved as suitable for both clinical and research use in Arabic-speaking populations, with no further modifications required. The final Arabic APS-POQ-R was distributed to the remaining 134 participants for data collection (Appendix A).

This systematic approach ensured a robust, transparent, and culturally appropriate adaptation and validation of the APS-POQ-R for Arabic-speaking target population.

### Results

#### Sample Characteristics

The  demographic,  social  and  clinical  charcterestics of the participants are summarised in Table 1. The majority of patients (78.0%) were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I,  whereas 22.0% were categorized as Grade II. In terms of surgical procedures, appendectomy was more frequently performed (55.3%) than cholecystectomy  (44.7%).  With  respect  to  postoperative analgesia,  only  6.0%  of  patients  received  strong opioids,  24.7%  received  weak  opioids,  and  the majority (69.3%) did not receive any opioid medications.

#### Internal Consistency Reliability

Internal  consistency  reliability  was  evaluated  for  the entire sample using Cronbach's alpha. The Arabic version of the APS-POQ-R  demonstrated  excellent  internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 for the total scale, surpassing the established threshold of 0.70 and closely mirroring values reported for the original English version.  Subgroup  analyses  from  both  the  pilot  phase and  the  full  study  cohort  revealed  Cronbach's  alpha coefficients  exceeding  0.80  across  all  major  domains, further  confirming  the  robustness  of  the  instrument. Moreover, participants reported no linguistic or cultural ambiguities  during  administration,  indicating  strong semantic  and  conceptual  equivalence  of  the  Arabic version. Detailed  reliability metrics  are  available  on request.

Analysis of data from the 150 participants indicated that postoperative pain scores were comparable between  appendectomy  and  cholecystectomy  procedures.  However,  the  prevalence  of  moderate-to-severe postoperative pain increased markedly over time, rising from 28.6% at 2 hours to 54.6% at 24 hours postoperatively. These findings underscore the persistent challenge of achieving effective pain control throughout the postoperative period.

### Discussion

This  study  represents  the  first  effort  to  translate  and validate the  revised  American  Pain  Society  Patient Outcome Questionnaire  (APSPOQR)  into  Arabic.  Originally developed by the American Pain Society in 1991 and revised  in  1995  and  2010,  the  APS-POQ-R  is  a  quality improvement  tool for assessing postoperative pain outcomes.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5</sup> Given the absence of an Arabic version, this study aimed to enhance postoperative pain evaluation and management in Arabicspeaking populations.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8-10</sup> 

Following established crosscultural adaptation guidelines,  a  systematic  process  of  forward  and  backward  translation,  expert  panel  review,  and  cognitive debriefing was implemented.  The  resulting version demonstrated semantic and cultural equivalence, requiring  only  minor  wording  refinements  for  clarity. Participants reported high comprehensibility and relevance to their experiences, confirming its appropriateness for clinical use.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11-14</sup> 

Psychometric  analysis  revealed  excellent  reliability, with  a  Cronbach's  alpha  of  0.90-comparable  to  or exceeding  values  reported  in  Chinese,  Turkish,  and Persian adaptations. Factor analysis supported the instrument's multidimensional structure, covering pain intensity, functional interference, emotional  distress, treatment side effects, and satisfaction with care. Although validation focused on Modern Standard Arabic,  broader  testing  across  regional  dialects  and surgical populations is warranted to confirm generalizability.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7,9,14</sup> 

The validated Arabic APSPOQR offers clinicians and researchers a reliable, patientcentred tool to assess pain and  guide  quality  improvement  initiatives  in  Arabicspeaking  healthcare  systems.  Future  studies  should evaluate its responsiveness to clinical changes and applicability  across  multiple  centres,  promoting  equitable pain management assessment across the Arab world.

### Conclusion

The  Arabic  version  of  the  APS-POQ-R  demonstrated excellent psychometric performance and is a culturally appropriate and clinically useful instrument for assessing postoperative pain among Arabic-speaking patients. Its use has the potential to enhance pain management practices,  promote  patient-centered  care,  and  contribute to international pain research through standardized data  collection  and  cross-cultural  comparisons.  Multicentre studies across different Arabic-speaking regions are recommended to strengthen its generalisability and inform future QI initiatives.
