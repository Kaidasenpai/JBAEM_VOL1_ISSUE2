### Abstract

In this review we summarise the 2024 ESC guideline recommendations comparing the  role  of  PCI  and  CABG  in  chronic  coronary  syndromes (CCS), highlighting common clinical scenarios, evidence levels, and decision-making principles. The guidelines support CABG as the preferred strategy  for  left  main  and  complex  multivessel  disease,  particularly among patients with diabetes mellitus and/or left ventricular dysfunction.  PCI  provides  comparable  survival  outcomes  in  low-anatomical-complexity disease (e.g., low SYNTAX score, significant left main or three-vessel  disease  in  non-diabetics).  For  single-  or  double-vessel disease involving the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), both PCI and CABG are equally recommended for prognostic benefit, whereas  isolated  non-LAD  disease  may  be  managed  with  PCI  for  symptom relief. In heart failure patients (EF ≤ 35%) with viable myocardium, CABG improves long-term survival, while PCI may be considered if surgery is contraindicated. The guidelines reinforce that the choice between CABG and  PCI  should  be  individualised  through  a  multidisciplinary  Heart Team approach. In short, CABG is favoured for complex anatomy, diabetic,  or  LV-dysfunction cases, while PCI is appropriate for lower-complex anatomy or in high surgical risk.

### Introduction

Chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) encompass patients with stable coronary artery disease who may experience angina  or  myocardial  infarction  in  the  long  term.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1</sup> In these  patients,  optimal  management  includes  guideline-directed medical therapy and, for appropriate cases, myocardial revascularisation using percutaneous coronary  intervention  (PCI)  or  coronary  artery  bypass grafting (CABG).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2</sup>

The  2024  European  Society  of  Cardiology  (ESC) Guidelines for  CCS  provide  detailed  recommendations on when to pursue revascularisation and how to choose between PCI and CABG.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3</sup> These recommendations are based on large clinical trials and meta-analyses, and are graded by Class (I, IIa, IIb, III) based on Levels of Evidence (A, B, and C) for clinical decision-making.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3</sup> A patient-centred, multidisciplinary 'Heart Team' approach is essential to deliver the most appropriate treatment and hence is necessitated by the latest guidelines.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4</sup>

Herein,  we  present  a  clinician-oriented  summary comparing PCI vs CABG according to the 2024 ESC CCS guidelines,  including  the  rationale  behind  recommendations, indications in various clinical scenarios, and key outcomes that guide modality selection.


### Indications for Revascularisation in Chronic Coronary Syndromes**

In CCS, revascularisation is generally indicated to improve  survival  in  certain  high-risk  anatomic  subsets and to relieve angina in patients who remain symptomatic  despite  medical  therapy.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4-7</sup> The  guidelines  underscore that significant left main coronary artery disease (≥ 50% stenosis) or extensive multivessel disease (three-vessel disease with ≥ 70% stenoses, or two-vessel disease including proximal LAD stenosis) are key indications  where  revascularisation  offers  prognostic  benefit. In these scenarios, especially for left main and/or proximal LAD involvement, revascularisation (by either CABG or  PCI  as  appropriate)  is  recommended  over  medical therapy alone to improve survival and clinical outcomes (Class I).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

Revascularisation is also indicated  for  symptom control  in  patients  with  angina  that  is  not  adequately controlled by optimal medical therapy.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7,9</sup> For example, in a  CCS  patient  with  severe  angina  and  a  functionally significant  lesion  in  the  proximal  LAD  (even  single-vessel), an intervention (PCI or CABG) may be recommended  to  improve  symptoms  and  prevent  adverse  events (Class I).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> The choice between CABG and PCI depends on multiple factors: the extent and complexity of coronary disease (often quantified by SYNTAX score), the presence of  comorbidities  (especially  diabetes  mellitus  or  left ventricular dysfunction), patient surgical risk and preferences, and the likelihood of achieving complete revascularisation  with  each  method.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,10-12</sup> Generally,  CABG  is favoured  in  more  diffuse  or  complex  disease  and  in patients  who  have  high-risk  features  (e.g.  diabetes  or impaired  LV  function)  because  of  its  more  durable results and survival benefit.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,13-15</sup> PCI is often favoured in patients with limited disease complexity or in those who are poor surgical candidates, owing to PCI's less invasive nature and shorter recovery.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,11,16</sup> Importantly, the guidelines stress that decisions should be individualised via a Heart Team consultation, particularly when both PCI and CABG seem equivalence and/or carry the same class of recommendation.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">17,18</sup> The Heart Team- comprising interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, non-invasive cardiologists, and others- should weigh anatomy, patient comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences  to  select  the  optimal  strategy.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">19,20</sup> Shared decision-making with the patient is paramount, ensuring the patient's values and choices are factored into the revascularisation plan.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">20</sup>

### Comparative  Evidence-Based:  PCI  vs  CABG  Outcomes

The  ESC  recommendations  draw  on  evidence  from multiple randomised trials and meta-analyses comparing PCI and  CABG  in  stable  CAD.  Overall, current evidence indicates that CABG tends to confer a longer-term  survival  advantage  in  certain  populations and  reduces  spontaneous  myocardial  infarctions  (MI) and repeat revascularisation compared to PCI. For example, in patients with complex multivessel disease (especially  those  with  diabetes),  trials  like  FREEDOM  and  a number of meta-analyses have shown that CABG significantly  lowers  rates  of  death  and  MI  over  follow-up relative to PCI, at the cost of a higher upfront procedural risk.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">21-23</sup> CABG's benefit is partly attributed to more complete revascularisation (including bypassing of multiple lesions  and  protecting  downstream  myocardium)  and the longevity of grafts, which translates to fewer repeat procedures.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10,24-25</sup> Indeed, the guidelines note that among patients anatomically eligible for both strategies, repeat re-intervention is consistently needed more often after PCI than after CABG, even with current-generation drug-eluting stents.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">26-27</sup>

By contrast, PCI offers the advantage  of lower invasiveness  and faster recovery, which can be important for patient preference and peri-procedural safety in high-risk surgical patients. In subsets of patients with less complex  coronary anatomy, PCI  has  demonstrated outcomes  comparable  to  CABG.  In  patients  with  left main or three-vessel disease of low anatomical complexity  (e.g.  SYNTAX  score  ≤22),  contemporary  trials  have shown no significant difference in all-cause mortality at five  years  between  PCI  (with  drug-eluting  stents)  and CABG, while PCI circumvent the morbidity of surgery.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10,28-29</sup> The guidelines explicitly state that in such low-complexity scenarios where complete revasculariza- tion  can  be  achieved  percutaneously,  PCI's  survival  is non-inferior  to  CABG.  However,  even  in  these  cases, differences  persist  in  non-mortality  outcomes:  CABG tends  to  better  prevent  spontaneous  (non-procedural) MI,  whereas  PCI  carries  a  higher  need  for  subsequent revascularisation  (often  due  to  progression  or  stent re-stenosis).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">21,30,31</sup> Both modalities have a similar long-term stroke risk, though CABG is known to have a higher peri-procedural stroke incidence.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">32</sup> These nuances  in  outcomes  underscore  why  the  guidelines  tailor recommendations  to  patient  subgroups-maximising survival and MI reduction (favouring CABG) versus minimising invasiveness and preserving comparable outcomes in select cases (favouring PCI).

Another critical piece of evidence is the presence of diabetes  mellitus.  Data  (e.g.  the  FREEDOM  trial  and others)  have  consistently  shown  that  diabetic  patients with multivessel disease derive a greater survival and MI reduction benefit from CABG than from PCI.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">13</sup> Conversely, PCI outcomes in diabetics have been less favourable, likely due to more diffuse atherosclerosis and higher risk of stent failure.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">13,33,34</sup> This evidence is reflected in stronger recommendations for CABG in diabetics and a caution or  even  contraindication  for  PCI  in  certain  scenarios (detailed  below).  Similarly,  in  patients  with  ischemic cardiomyopathy (e.g.  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  ≤ 35% due to CAD), surgical revascularisation (as shown by trials like STICH) improves survival versus medical therapy, whereas the benefit of PCI in this setting is less established.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">14,15</sup> The  guidelines  incorporate  these  findings  by preferentially  recommending  CABG  when  significant viable-but ischemic-myocardium exists in HFrEF patients.

The best available evidence can be distilled as follows: surgical revascularisation is more complete and durable than  PCI, with  proven  survival benefit in extensive disease  (especially  with  diabetes  or  impaired  LV  function),  while PCI yields comparable survival in lower-risk anatomy and offers advantages in less invasiveness and initial  safety.  These  principles  inform  the  guideline's class-of-recommendation for each clinical scenario that will be summarised in the next paragraphs.

### Guideline Recommendations by Clinical Scenario

**Left Main Coronary Artery Disease**

For CCS patients with significant left main (LM) coronary stenosis, the guidelines strongly favour revascularisation for  prognostic  benefit.  In  a  patient  at  low  surgical  risk with  ≥50%  LM  stenosis,  CABG  is  recommended  over medical therapy alone to improve survival (Class I, Level A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">35-37</sup> Furthermore,  CABG  is  recommended  as  the overall  preferred  revascularisation  modality  over  PCI  in left main disease, given CABG's lower risk of spontaneous MI and need for repeat revascularisation (Class I, A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,21,28,37,38</sup> This means that, all else being equal, surgery is  the  first-line  revascularisation  strategy  for  left  main CAD in suitable surgical candidates (Table 1).

Table 1: Left Main Coronary Artery Disease

| Clinical Scenario                      | CABG Recommendation                   | PCI Recommendation                                  | Key Considerations                                                      |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low complexity (SYNTAX ≤22)            | Class I, Level A (preferred overall)  | Class I, Level A (acceptable alternative)           | Both equally endorsed if complete revascularization achievable with PCI |
| Intermediate complexity (SYNTAX 23-32) | Class I, Level A (preferred )         | Class IIa, Level A (may be considered)              | CABG preferred due to outcome differences at moderate complexity        |
| High complexity (SYNTAX >32)           | Class I, Level A (strongly preferred) | Not recommended (by omission)                       | Surgical revascularization is default for very complex lesions          |
| High surgical risk/ inoperable         | Contraindicated (due to risk)         | Class IIb, Level B (may be considered with caution) | PCI as compromise when CABG not feasible                                |

However, the guidelines also acknowledge that PCI can  be  an  acceptable  alternative  in  select  left  main patients with less complex disease. If the left main lesion is  associated  with  low  anatomical  complexity  (SYNTAX score ≤22) and complete revascularisation can be achieved  with  PCI,  then  PCI  is  recommended  as  an alternative to CABG in those patients (Class I, Level A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> In other  words,  for  a  low-SYNTAX  left  main  (for  example, isolated  left  main  disease  or  left  main  plus  one-vessel disease with favourable anatomy), PCI and CABG both carry  a  Class  I/A  recommendation-PCI  is  considered non-inferior to surgery in terms  of survival in this subgroup,  while  being  less  invasive.  The  heart  team should then weigh patient preference and operative risk in making the final recommendation. isolated left main disease or left main plus one-vessel disease with favourable  anatomy,  PCI  and  CABG  both  carry  a  Class  I/A recommendation-PCI is considered non-inferior to surgery in terms of survival in this subgroup, while being less invasive. The heart team should then weigh patient preference and operative risk in making the final recommendation.

For  intermediate  anatomical  complexity  left  main disease  (SYNTAX  23-32),  PCI  is  given  a  slightly  lower profile: it 'may be considered' (Class IIa, Level A) in cases where, again, equivalent revascularisation completeness can  be  attained  percutaneously.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">11,39-41</sup> This  represents  a downgrade  from  Class  I  to  IIa  for  PCI  in  intermediate-SYNTAX left main, reflecting some lingering outcome differences at moderate complexity in favour of CABG. At high complexity (SYNTAX &gt;32), the implication is  that  PCI  is  generally  not  recommended-the  guidelines do not explicitly list a Class III, but by omission and prior evidence, surgical revascularisation is the default for very complex left main lesions.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,34,40-42</sup>

It is important to highlight the scenario of the patient with left main disease who is a high surgical risk or inoperable: patients with significant left main CAD who have prohibitive  surgical  risk  (due  to  age,  frailty,  comorbidities),  the  guidelines  allow  that  PCI  may  be  considered over medical therapy alone as a revascularisation strategy  (Class  IIb,  B).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,4</sup> This  ensures  that  even  those  who cannot undergo CABG have an option for revascularisation;  PCI  in  this  context  is  a  compromise  approach  to improve symptoms (and possibly prognosis) when CABG is not feasible. A heart team evaluation is critical here to document the surgical risk and to proceed with PCI only if the expected benefits of surgery outweighs the associated risk.

In  summary,  for  left  main  CCS:  CABG  is  generally preferred for its outcome benefit (Class I), PCI is equally endorsed if anatomy is favourable (Class I for low complexity, IIa for intermediate), and PCI can be done as the second  best  option  in  high-risk  surgical  patients  (IIb). Notably,  the  2024  guidelines  were  endorsed  by  both cardiology  and  cardiothoracic  surgery  societies,  resolving prior debates over left main management by focusing on complete revascularisation and SYNTAX score in guiding PCI vs CABG.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

**Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease (Three-Vessel CAD)**

Three-vessel  coronary  artery  disease  (3VD)  is  another scenario where revascularisation improves the long term outcome,  notably,  the  guidelines  differentiate  recommendations  based  on  the  presence  of  diabetes  and disease complexity (Table 2).


Table 2: Three-Vessel Disease

| Patient Population                                | CABG Recommendation          | PCI Recommendation                                            | Key Considerations                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| With diabetes mellitus + acceptable surgical risk | Class I, Level A             | Class III, Level A (not recommended if SYNTAX >22)            | Robust evidence for CABG superiority in diabetics   |
| Diabetes + very high surgical risk                | High risk procedure          | Class IIa, Level B (can be considered)                        | PCI when CABG truly not an option                   |
| Without diabetes (preserved LV function)          | Class I, Level A             | Class I, Level A (if low-intermediate complexity, SYNTAX ≤32) | Equal recommendations when anatomy suitable for PCI |
| Without diabetes (high complexity)                | Class I, Level A (preferred) | Lower priority (not explicitly stated)                        | Higher Priority for CABG                            |

For  multivessel  disease  in  patients  with  diabetes mellitus (DM), the evidence strongly favours surgery. In CCS patients with significant three-vessel CAD and coexistent  type  2  diabetes,  particularly  if  angina  persists despite commencing on medical therapy according to guidelines,  CABG  is  recommended  over  both  medical therapy alone and over PCI to improve symptoms and outcomes (Class I, Level A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">13,43</sup> This strong recommendation for CABG in diabetics reflects robust data that CABG reduces mortality and MI in diabetic multivessel patients, whereas PCI is inferior in this group. Accordingly, the guidelines essentially prioritise CABG as the revascularisation method of choice for diabetic patients with multivessel disease. In fact, PCI is not recommended for diabetic 3-vessel patients if the anatomical complexity is intermediate  or  high  (SYNTAX  &gt;22),  given  the  higher event rates observed with stenting in this cohort (Class III, A for PCI in DM with SYNTAX &gt;22). Only if the anatomy is relatively  simple  (SYNTAX  0-22)  and  the  surgical  risk  is not acceptable might PCI be considered, and even then, the  guideline  assigns  this  a  weak  recommendation (approximately Class IIb) for diabetics. Thus, unless there are extenuating circumstances, a diabetic with multivessel  disease  should  be  directed  to  CABG  for  prognostic benefit. One such extenuating circumstance is very high surgical  risk:  in  a  diabetic  patient  who  is  an  extremely high-risk  surgical  candidate  (e.g.  due  to  severe  comorbidities, frailty, reduced life expectancy, etc.), the guidelines  state  that  PCI  'can  be  considered'  over  medical therapy  to  relieve  ischemia  and  improve  short  term outcome (Class IIa, B).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6,44</sup> This provides a path for intervention when CABG is truly not an option, although the expected benefits with PCI would be more for symptom control than for equal longevity benefit in this subgroup.

For three-vessel disease in patients without diabetes (and with preserved LV function), the recommendations are  a  bit  more  balanced.  If  the  patient  remains  symptomatic on medical therapy, revascularisation is recommended over medical therapy alone to improve symptoms, survival, and reduce ischemic events (Class I, A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">45-47</sup> In other words, revascularisation is clearly indicated for significant 3VD in non-diabetics as well. When it comes to choosing the mode of revascularisation in non-diabetics,  the  guidelines  give  a  nod  to  PCI  in  cases  of  lower complexity:  in  a  patient  with  3-vessel  CAD  of  low-tointermediate anatomical complexity (again roughly SYNTAX ≤32) where PCI is deemed to achieve a similar completeness of revascularisation as CABG, PCI is recommended as an alternative to surgery (Class I, Level A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">48-52</sup> The wording 'PCI is recommended' (Class I) in this context is significant - it effectively places PCI on equal footing with CABG for non-diabetic 3VD when anatomy is  favourable.  The  rationale  is  that  for  such  patients, studies have shown generally non-inferior survival with PCI versus CABG, especially in the era of improved stents and medical therapy - be it with follow up limited to five years or less. Therefore, the choice can be individualised based  on  patient  preference,  with  the  understanding that  PCI  will  have  the  advantage  of  less  invasiveness while offering similar hard outcomes in the short-to-medium term.

If the 3-vessel anatomy in a non-diabetic is very complex (e.g. diffuse disease, high SYNTAX) such that complete  revascularisation  by  PCI  is  doubtful,  then  CABG remains the preferred modality (Class I). The ESC guidelines incorporate this by restricting the Class I indication for PCI to low-intermediate complexity disease, and by recommending  a  Heart  Team  evaluation  of  anatomy, SYNTAX score, and likelihood of complete revascularisa- tion before choosing PCI over CABG in 3VD.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

In  practice,  for  a  non-diabetic  patient  with  3-vessel CAD, if the SYNTAX score is low or moderate and lesions are suitable, PCI can be offered as an equal alternative (with Class I support), whereas if the disease is extensive, CABG should be selected to maximise survival benefits and freedom from MI.

Summary for 3-vessel disease: For diabetic patients, CABG  is  strongly  favoured  (Class  I/A),  PCI  generally discouraged except possibly in low SYNTAX cases (PCI is Class  IIb  at  best,  and  Class  III/not  recommended  if SYNTAX &gt;22). For non-diabetic patients, both CABG and PCI  are  Class  I  options  if  anatomy  is  suitable  for  PCI; otherwise, CABG is indicated. In all cases, ensure symptoms  or ischemia justify revascularisation (since in asymptomatic  low-risk  disease,  one  might  continue medical  therapy).  The  Heart  Team  should  consider diabetes  status,  SYNTAX  score,  anticipated  completeness of revascularisation, and comorbidities when deciding on PCI vs CABG in multivessel disease.

**Single or Double-Vessel Disease**

For patients with one or two-vessel coronary disease, the need for CABG vs PCI depends largely on whether the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) is involved and on symptom burden. The proximal LAD supplies a large  territory  of  the  myocardium;  thus,  a  significant proximal  LAD  stenosis  carries  a  higher  risk,  as  with multivessel disease, and thus merits durable revascularisation strategy (Table 3).

Table 3: Single/Two-Vessel Disease

| Anatomical Location               | CABG Recommendation                                        | PCI Recommendation                            | Key Considerations                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Involving proximal LAD            | Class I, Level A (either modality acceptable)              | Class I, Level A (either modality acceptable) | Both equally valid for prognostic benefit                                                                       |
| Complex proximal LAD lesion       | Class I, Level B (preferred for durability)                | Lower priority                                | CABG preferred for complex LAD lesions not amenable to PCI                                                      |
| Not involving proximal LAD (pLAD) | Class IIb, Level C (may be considered if PCI not feasible) | Class I, Level B (in selected cases)          | Debatable benefits from revasularistion, however, PCI typically first choice for non-pLAD single/ double vessel |

In CCS  patients  with  significant single-vessel or two-vessel  disease  that  involves  the  proximal  LAD,  if angina and/or ischemia persists despite optimal medical therapy, revascularisation (either PCI or CABG) is recommended over medical therapy alone to improve symptoms and outcomes (Class I, A).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> This means that even if a patient  has  otherwise  limited  disease,  a  high-grade proximal  LAD  lesion  should  be  fixed  (assuming  the patient is a suitable  candidate),  because  doing  so improves prognosis and quality of life.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">45,53-57</sup> In practice, PCI is often the first choice for an isolated proximal LAD lesion  given  its  accessibility  and  the  patient's  likely preference  to  avoid  surgery;  however,  CABG  using  the left internal mammary artery in particular, is an equally valid approach, particularly if the LAD lesion is not easily amenable to stenting (e.g. very long or calcified plaque). It is worth noting that in patients with complex lesions in the LAD, there is a higher chance that repeated revascularisation  at  a  later  stage  would  be  required  after  PCI compared  to  CABG.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">58</sup>  In  the  meantime,  due  to  the invasive  and  high-risk  nature  of  CABG  in  comparison with PCI, patients would stay in hospitals longer, and the healing is slower.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">59</sup> The guidelines address this nuance: if a  proximal  LAD  lesion  (single  or  two-vessel  disease)  is complex and less amenable to PCI, then CABG is specifically  recommended  to  improve  symptoms  and  to reduce  the  need  for  repeat  revascularisation  (Class  I, Level B).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> In other words, for a tough LAD lesion (or where multiple lesions, including the LAD, would require multiple stents), surgical bypass (typically using the left internal  mammary artery graft to the LAD) is the preferred strategy because of its superior long-term patency and outcomes.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">60-62</sup> This recommendation acknowledges the well-known benefit of LIMA-LAD grafting for long-term survival in CAD compared to CABG.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">58</sup>

In symptomatic CCS patients with one or two-vessel disease not involving the proximal LAD, the urgency for revascularisation  is  lower  since  the  territory  at  risk  is smaller.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">55,63-64</sup> The guidelines state that if such a patient remains symptomatic on medical therapy, PCI is recommended to improve symptoms (Class I, B).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> PCI in this scenario  is  typically  straightforward  (e.g.  stenting  an isolated right coronary or circumflex lesion) and provides effective angina  relief.  CABG  is  rarely  warranted  in single/double-vessel disease without proximal LAD involvement; the guidelines note that if the lesions are not amenable to PCI, CABG may be considered to relieve symptoms (Class IIb, C).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> An example might be a proximal  dominant  circumflex  occlusion  not  suitable  for  a stent  due  to  tortuosity-surgery  could  be  an  option, though it's a Class IIb (weak) recommendation, underscoring that medical therapy is also acceptable if revascularisation  risk  is  high.  In  general,  isolated  non-LAD lesions are managed with PCI, if anything, and CABG is reserved for those unusual cases where PCI is not possible or has failed and symptoms are significant.

Across all these scenarios, it should be remembered that optimal medical therapy (anti-anginals, risk factor modification, etc.) remains the cornerstone of CCS management.  Revascularisation  is typically  pursued when medicine is insufficient  or  when  there  is  a  clear prognostic benefit (as in left main or extensive disease). The guidelines reinforce that lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy are fundamental, with revascularisation built on that foundation.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>

**Patients with Heart Failure or Left Ventricular Dysfunction**

A special subgroup of CCS patients is those with heart failure  and  reduced  ejection  fraction  (HFrEF)  due  to ischemic heart disease (often termed ischemic cardiomyopathy). In these patients (LVEF ≤35%), viability and perfusion  of  myocardium  become  considerations  for revascularisation  decisions.  The  2024  ESC  guidelines advise  an  aggressive  approach  to  identify  and  treat coronary lesions in this population.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup> Specifically, in heart failure  patients  (EF  ≤35%)  with  suspected  CAD,  an invasive  coronary  angiogram  (ICA)  is  recommended  to evaluate for disease amenable to revascularisation (Class I,  B).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8,65-68</sup> The rationale is to look for CAD that could be surgically bypassed to improve prognosis, as evidenced by trials like STICH.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">69</sup> CABG can confer a survival benefit in patients with impaired EF by restoring blood flow to hibernating myocardium.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">70,71</sup> Thus, if  significant  CAD  is found  in  an  HFrEF  patient  after  ICA,  especially  if  it's multivessel, CABG is the preferred modality to attempt to improve long-term survival and heart failure outcomes  after  considering  the  risk-to-benefit  ratio  of the procedures (this is aligned with Class I recommendation for CABG in 3VD with LV dysfunction) (Table 4).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8</sup>


Table 4: Heart Failure/ LV Dysfunction

| Clinical Scenario                                        | CABG Recommendation                      | PCI Recommendation                                        | Key Considerations                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| HFrEF (EF ≤ 35%) with multivessel CAD                    | Class I (preferred for survival benefit) | Alternative if CABG is contraindicated                    | CABG shown to improve survival in ischemic cardiomyopathy |
| HFrEF (EF ≤ 35%) with multivessel CAD-high surgical risk | Standard approach only if suitable       | Class IIb, Level C (mechanical support may be considered) | Mechanical circulatory support for high-risk PCI          |

PCI in the context of severe LV dysfunction is less studied,  and  the  guidelines  do  not  give  it  a  primary recommendation for prognostic improvement; however, PCI may be used for symptom relief or if a patient cannot undergo surgery. One notable point in the guidelines is that for selected HFrEF patients undergoing a high-risk PCI  (e.g.  complex  multivessel  stenting  in  a  low  EF patient),  the  use  of  a  mechanical  circulatory  support device (such as a percutaneous microaxial flow pump) may be considered to reduce peri-procedural risk (Class IIb,  C).<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">8,72-74</sup> This  is  more  of  a  technical  adjunct  recommendation, reflecting the need for caution when doing PCI in  very  sick  heart  failure  patients.  Nonetheless,  the overarching guideline message for ischemic cardiomyopathy  is  to  consider  surgical  revascularisation  (CABG) for  eligible  patients  to  improve  survival,  whereas  PCI would be an alternative if surgery is contraindicated or as a  bridge  in  certain  cases.  All  such  patients  should  be managed  in  a  multidisciplinary  heart  failure  team  as well, optimising medical therapy (e.g. beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, etc.) alongside any revascularisation to decrease mortality.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup>  well,  optimising  medical  therapy  (e.g.  beta-blockers,  ACE  inhibitors,  SGLT2 inhibitors,  etc.)  alongside  revascularisation  to  decrease mortality.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7</sup>


### Conclusion

The 2024  ESC  CCS  guidelines  provide a  nuanced, evidence-based  framework  for  choosing  between  PCI and CABG in patients with stable coronary disease.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2,8</sup> In summary, CABG is favoured for patients with left main or complex multivessel disease, especially in the presence of diabetes or reduced ejection fraction, due to its association with improved survival, fewer MI events, and more durable results.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">24</sup>

PCI is an equal alternative in scenarios of less complex  anatomy  (low  SYNTAX)  where  outcomes  have proven comparable, such as low-complexity left main or three-vessel disease in non-diabetics. For patients with limited one or two-vessel disease, PCI is usually sufficient for symptom relief, with CABG reserved for proximal LAD lesions or cases not amenable to stenting. Throughout all recommendations, there is a strong emphasis on individualised care: employing the Heart Team  to integrate clinical factors (anatomy, diabetes, LV function, surgical risk) and patient preferences to arrive at the best revascularisation  strategy.  By  adhering  to  these  guidelines,  clinicians  can  ensure  that  patients  with  chronic coronary syndromes receive therapy (whether PCI, CABG,  or  medical  management)  that  is  best  aligned with their clinical profile and supported by the highest level of evidence.
